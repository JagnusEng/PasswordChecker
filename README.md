# PasswordChecker

Welcome to Password Checker! This simple Python script checks the strength of user-entered passwords based on specific criteria.

## Password Strength Criteria

1. **Length**: Password must be at least seven characters long.
2. **Special Characters**: Password must contain at least one special character from the set: `!@#$%^&*()_-=+\]|`
3. **Numbers**: Password must contain at least one digit.
4. **Case Sensitivity**: Password must have at least one uppercase and one lowercase letter.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to enter your password and receive feedback on its strength.
4. You have three attempts to enter a strong password; otherwise, you'll need to try again later.
